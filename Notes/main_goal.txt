Creating a web application that contains 2 main parts:

Part I:

A platform that contains a template for creating quiz files

The template should contain following options:

    1. Add a multiple-choice question to your quiz with 1 answer
    2. Add a multiple-choice question to your quiz with 2 answers (multiple response)
    3. True or False
    4. Short answer
    5. Fill in the blanks
    6. Matching -- one part of the solution to the other (like a puzzle)
    7. Voice file + input field (cat MultiMedia)
    8. Image file + input field (cat MultiMedia)

!!! TO DO: Consider how will the answers of the participants be evaluated:
        option 1: the quiz moderator should do that
        option 2: the answers should be evaluated by the back-end


Part II:

!!! OPTION #1: To make it a 1 participant only experience --> you open a quiz someone else created
!!! OPTION #2: Real-time game in which the quiz creator administrates the game for friends.
!!! OPTION #3 (probably best):
                    Moderator view: Presenting the quiz (question by question)
                    Participants view: <title>Question name</title> -> answer form + submit

                    Moderator receives answers, evaluates them and sends them back to the users!! (how???)
                    By evaluating and submitting - the moderator updates the current score of participants



Platform for executing the quiz --> which should be started manually by the Quiz creator.

An option to add participants by username of the participant.
